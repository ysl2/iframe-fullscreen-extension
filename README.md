<img width=100% alt="" src="assets/README/img/2025-08-01-23-46-52.png" />

A powerful browser extension that adds a "Fullscreen" button to iframes on any webpage, with advanced controls to customize its behavior.

## Features

- **Universal Fullscreen Button**: Overlays a clean fullscreen button on iframes, allowing you to expand embedded content easily.
- **Advanced Settings Panel**: Click the extension icon in your browser toolbar to open the settings popup.
- **Customizable Default Behavior**:
    - **Default On**: Show the fullscreen button on all websites by default.
    - **Default Off**: Disable the button by default and only show it on specific sites.
- **Granular Site Control**:
    - **Blacklist**: When in "Default On" mode, you can add website URLs (using regular expressions) to a blacklist to prevent the button from appearing on those sites.
    - **Whitelist**: When in "Default Off" mode, you can add website URLs (using regular expressions) to a whitelist to show the button only on your chosen sites.
- **Robust and Non-Intrusive**: The button is added without altering the page's layout, preventing common display issues on complex websites.
- **Handles Dynamic Content**: Uses modern JavaScript observers to detect and handle iframes that are loaded dynamically.

## Installation

1.  Download or clone the extension files into a local folder (e.g., `iframe-fullscreen-extension`).
2.  Open your browser's extension page:
    -   **Chrome**: `chrome://extensions`
    -   **Edge**: `edge://extensions`
3.  Enable **Developer mode** (usually a toggle in the top-right corner).
4.  Click on the **"Load unpacked"** button.
5.  Select the `iframe-fullscreen-extension` folder.

The extension is now installed and active!

## How to Use

1.  **Click the extension icon** in your browser toolbar to open the settings.
2.  **Choose your preferred mode**: "Default On" or "Default Off".
3.  **Configure your blacklist/whitelist** using regular expressions for precise control (e.g., `https://www.example.com/.*`).
4.  Navigate to any webpage. The fullscreen button will appear on iframes according to your rules. Click it to enter fullscreen mode.
